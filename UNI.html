        <p1>The job of a gameplay programmer, in general, is to write code that the player interacts with whilst playing the game. The scope of the job can vary between companies with some expecting the gameplay programmer to complete jobs too brief to hire a specialist to do, whereas, some consider the job to be for those with both excellent design and programming skills. Often the job requires you to be versatile and able to adapt quickly to new disciplines as the task may span many areas of game development (Powell, 2012). A gameplay programmer should also be able to work well with a design team to make their element fit with the feel and style of the game and respond to feedback about improvements or bugs found by the Quality Assurance team. Any code written should be optimized for performance and memory usage as required, should come with clear documentation, and adhere to the studios coding standards.

    <section class = "paragraph">
        <p1>Common advice for new Gameplay programmers is to keep asking questions, showing that you are willing to learn and adapt will keep your employer happy. If you have quite a few questions, write them down and ask them in one go rather than disturbing your boss multiple times a day. Another piece of advice is that large code bases can be daunting but you will get used to it, it just take time.
